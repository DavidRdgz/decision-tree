# Why
This package is intended for those trying to classifying signals from sensors. In particular, this package gives the capability to make

1. Trees
2. Forests

Additionally, there are a variety of options to speed up the process of finding the best splitting point over each signal. These techniques are coined _threshing_.

2. Uniform
3. K-Tile
